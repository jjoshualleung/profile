## Projects

### Data Pipeline Development and Analysis for Kiwifruit Drop in Italy (Zespri)
- Designed and implemented a data processing pipeline to analyze relationships between kiwifruit drop and various environmental and physiological metrics.
- Engineered features such as fruit drop ratio and vapour pressure deficit to understand the impact of weather on kiwifruit physiology.
- Utilized ER diagram to model complex data relationships, ensuring the robustness of the data model.

### Site Density Analysis in Minneapolis and Minnesota (PoLTE)
- Evaluated cell network models, focusing on analyzing sector count and density per square kilometer to understand carrier coverage.
- Utilized H3 geospatial indexing in analyzing quality statistics of the tower database for each carrier.
- Identified T-Mobile as the carrier with the second-highest maximum density in Minneapolis and the highest maximum density in Minnesota.
